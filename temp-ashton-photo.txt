User provided the correct Ashton Soniat CEO photo.
This is a circular cropped professional headshot showing:
- A professional businessman in business attire
- Clean, professional appearance
- Appropriate for CEO executive team page
- Should replace the current placeholder photo

The user is frustrated that I used a random stock photo instead of the actual CEO photo they wanted.
I need to save this specific image and use it on the website.
